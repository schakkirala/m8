DMV License Test score Data
DMV road assessment for applicants who had applied for a new driverâ€™s license. 
This dataset is simulated and contains information on whether an applicant passed the test, including applicant's ID, gender, age, race, trainings, 
and all road assessment indicators. By analyzing this data, various insights can be derived, such as predicting the likelihood of future applicants
passing the road test.

This project demonstrates use of Dask python library which is designed to handle large dataset, larger than RAM by streaming and chunking data
